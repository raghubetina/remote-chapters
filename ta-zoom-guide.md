## How to create the recurring Zoom Meeting in Canvas

From the course page on Canvas, select the Zoom tab on the left sidebar to open the Zoom dashboard.

From here, you can schedule meetings or view/edit/share meeting recordings.

### Meeting Settings

When creating a meeting for class keep the following in mind:

* Name the meeting after the course and section. 
* Schedule the meeting to start on the first day of the section.
	* Make sure that whoever is the host of the meeting does not have any meeting conflicts with the start time so students can join early.
	* You can set the "Enable join before Host" option to accomplish this as well.
* Choose recurring meeting, and set whatever makes most sense for your class.
	* For example, if your course once a week on Mondays, set the Recurrence to Weekly, choose Monday, and specify the date of the last class.
	* You can specify multiple meetings per week if necessary.


## Recording Tips

You can trim the beginning and end of a recorded meeting in the Zoom Cloud. However, you can't cut out any segments in the middle. Instead, you can **pause** a recording so there are not long periods of no content in the recordings. Starting/Pausing/Stopping a recording is very audible to everyone in the meeting. In order to minimize the disruption during class, try to start/pause recordings at only key times during the session.

- During a break out session
	- Only the main room is recorded, breakout rooms are not recorded. So if nothing important is happening in the main room, you should pause the recording until the breakout rooms end.
	- This might involve you jumping out of _your_ break out room as soon as it starts so you can pause the recording and then jump back in to your assigned room.
	- Resume recording as soon as most breakout rooms have closed when you return to the main room or when you’re sure that all the rooms have been closed.
			
- During a class break
	- If the class is going on a break pause the recording
	- If the instructor calls for break and a student sticks behind for a question, try to wait for the question to be resolved before stopping the recording.
	- Resume at the time specified by the instructor, as long as the instructor present.

### Posting the recording
On the Recording Details page of a meeting
Zoom will save multiple different files for one meeting.

- Shared screen with gallery view
- Speaker view
- Shared screen
- Gallery view
- Shared screen with speaker view
- Chat file

Unfortunately, these recordings are not labeled on this page. Excluding the chat file, you need to open each one up individually to determine what the recording is. 

If the instructor often shares their screen, you’ll usually want to post the "Shared screen with speaker view" recording on Canvas.

Before you post a meeting recording, you can trim the video to change the starting and ending points.

_Trimming a recording is only possible if you are the user who created the meeting._

_This will not affect the original recording. **If you enable downloads, viewers will have access to the full-length recording and all relevant files**, including audio transcripts, chat, and subtitles._

Once you’ve trimmed the video enough and click "Save", you can copy the URL of this page, or 
Then copy the URL from the current recording page, or from the Recording details page for the meeting you can click the "Share" button to find the link, and post it to Canvas.

_Note: You can’t record breakout room sessions._

## Management

### Presentation issues

Alert the instructor:

- if they have accidentally muted themselves
- if their mic is too quiet or too loud
- if they have background noise leaking in that they might not be aware
- if they haven’t shared screen but seem to think they have and are referring to it

### Reading chat

Keep an eye on chat. If any questions or comments are in-scope to the current topic and would benefit the discussion, then escalate it to the instructors attention at an appropriate moment if the instructor doesn’t notice them. Otherwise answer the question yourself in the chat.

### Non-verbal feedback management

- TA’s are responsible for being on the lookout for A/V or any other presentation issues and alert the instructor to them
- Alert the instructor to raised hands if they don’t notice them
- Lower a raised hand if the student doesn’t do it themselves
- Clear all the responses when the activity is over if the instructor forgets to
- Mute people if they don’t mute themselves

### Extra 

- Take screenshots at key times (e.g. whiteboard drawings) for later posting
- Paste reference links into chat when appropriate
